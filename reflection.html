    <h1>Nature and Algorithms</h1>

    <h2>What kinds of problems can we observe in nature?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: The repeated cycle of day and night.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursion</strong>: Fractal shapes in snowflakes or tree branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking</strong>: Bees searching for flowers and finding their way back to the hive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is space and time efficiency, and why are they important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time efficiency</strong>: Measures how long an algorithm takes to finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Space efficiency</strong>: Measures how much storage the algorithm needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They are important to ensure programs run smoothly and donâ€™t waste time or resources.</p>

    <h2>What have you learned from the design principles in Chapter 2?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Trees</strong>: Keep data accessible and quick to retrieve.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Searches</strong>: Help solve problems like finding routes or connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorting Techniques</strong>: Show how to split problems into smaller parts for faster results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do tree structures optimize problem-solving scenarios?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BST</strong>: Helps find things faster by keeping them in order.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Trees</strong>: Avoids uneven data that can slow down searches.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized Trees</strong>: Fit specific tasks, like organizing words or prioritizing tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why are array query algorithms important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Segment Trees</strong>: Quickly answer questions about parts of the data.</li>
        <li><strong>BIT</strong>: Keep updates fast without recalculating everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do tree and graph traversal algorithms differ?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tree Traversals</strong>: Follow a clear structure with no repeating paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Traversals</strong>: Handle more complex networks with loops and multiple routes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do sorting and searching algorithms connect to the real world?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sorting</strong>: Used to arrange items like event schedules or customer orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Searching</strong>: Finds what you need quickly, like a contact in your phone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why are graph algorithms important in spanning trees and shortest path problems?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spanning Trees</strong>: Help minimize costs in building networks, like pipelines or roads.</li>
        <li><strong>Shortest Path</strong>: Used for finding the quickest way to reach a destination or solve a delivery problem.</li>
    </ul>
